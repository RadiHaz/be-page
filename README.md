# Angular SPA + Simulated REST API with json server

## Running:

1. Open a terminal and cd into root of the project and run `npm i`

2. To start the REST API, open a **NEW** terminal instance or tab, exclusively for this service, and cd into the **data** folder and run `json server --watch db.json`

3. At a new terminal instance, cd to the project root and run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. The `-o` flag will automatically open a new tab and navigate your browser to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
